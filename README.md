This little program aims at arousing your interests in this topic. Hopefully it could inspire you to creating something with your own knowledge and skills.

An online demo is here: http://dylanyy.com/Projects/maze_generator/

If you're new of maze-generation, this project may give you a basic understanding of how to randomly generate a maze. The idea to get there is using DFS traversing all the cells in the maze.
